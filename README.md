1) Laser Materials Testing:
we tested 6 different seetings (speed, power, frequency) on the laser cutter to find some good laser settings for cutting and engraving the materials.
my settings: 100, 1, 6000; 80, 5, 6000; 50, 10, 6000; 100, 48, 6000; 80, 3, 6000; 60, 7, 6000

2) Homework:
Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.
I designed a carriage for my flower so I wan walk around with her outside. The base and holder for the plant are cutted out form a acrylic sheet and the rest are found objects. the seeting I used was: 40,50,1.5
